# practica-node-mongoDB

Simple connection using node and mongoDB with Samsung Desarrolladoras course

# At first, run npm install

You will start with `npm install` command. This will install all dependencies.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory root, you can run:

### `node main` üöÄ

`node main` command will run the server at the port 4000 [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

### Test with Postman

Then, you can open POSTMAN app, select POST method and in the request body select the www-form-urlencoded option and send a cool user object with Name, Last Name, Age, Phone, Favorite Color, and Wish, like this. This object will be saved in MongoDB database.

Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view the users list it in the browser.

I added a file with the Postman collection to testing to make your life easier ü§û
